                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Wisedom.ai was born out of a simple but overwhelming reality: in today's hyperconnected world, we all juggle thousands of relationships across emails, texts, calendars, and social platforms â€” yet there's no central brain that helps us keep track.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  Our founder experienced this problem firsthand while building companies, investing in startups, and managing a network of over 10,000 professional and personal contacts. Every project brought new opportunities, but also new headaches: scattered conversations, missed follow-ups, outdated contact info, and the impossible task of manually keeping a CRM current.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  Instead of hiring more assistants or relying on siloed tools, we asked: What if the assistant itself could be replaced with intelligence? Wisedom.ai began as a vision to create a personal operating system for relationships â€” one that syncs your contacts, understands context, remembers every interaction, and nudges you at the right moment.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  From this need, RelationshipOS was built: the first step toward a larger vision of an ecosystem where your network becomes a living, searchable, and constantly updating map of opportunities. We're building Wisedom.ai to take the work out of managing relationships, so you can focus on what really matters: the conversations, the trust, and the opportunities that drive your life forward.
